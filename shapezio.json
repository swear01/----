To keep it simple I used only 8 bits per layer (four shapes is two bits, times four quadrants is eight bits).  Those bits drive transistors that are connected to the filters (gates) on the display.  The transistors are triggered with a 15 hz strobe (1 tick wide pulse 15 times per second).  Cycle through a list of shapes, and it can display anything.\n\nIn theory, you could have an 7-bit ascii character set stored in ROM, and a single 4-layer shape could store up to 11 characters.  Imagine, a single shape could store \"Hello World\" and still have 3 bits left over.",
